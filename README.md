# Emotion Classification using Deep Transfer Learning

## Context

This project aims to classify images from the "Natural Human Face Dataset" using a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model, such as VGG16, and transfer learning techniques. The focus is on three emotion categories: fear, happiness, and sadness
